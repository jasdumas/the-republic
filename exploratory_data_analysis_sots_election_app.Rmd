## Project Goals

Obtain Election Results from http://ctemspublic.pcctg.net/#/home. A web scraper is a programiatic way of isolating data that is stored in a web page. This particular set of data is not made available within the HTML, and located offline as an Angular App through the Secretary of State office in Connecticut. 

The 2016 Presidential election results in Connecticut have already been parsed by Jake Kara or TrendCT.org!

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(rvest)
library(emo)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(wesanderson)
library(stringr)
```

### Web Scraping Attempts

Below are some practice lines using the `rvest` `r emo::ji('package')` in my attempt to web scrape data with the url. I may have to re-visit this to get new data that is published on the SOTS site for municipal elections.

```{r}
url <- "http://ctemspublic.pcctg.net/#/home"

html_content <- read_html(url)
html_content

# trying this
#html_content %>% 
#  html_nodes("div") %>% 
#  html_text() 

# and this
#html_content %>% 
#  html_table(".colum2", fill=T) 
```

#### Parsed data:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=T}
potus_election <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakekara/ct-election-2016-certified-data/master/output/merged_state_votes_pretty.csv")

head(potus_election) 
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
# how many differnt parties represented = 10
potus_election %>% group_by(party_name) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = fct_reorder(party_name, count), y = count)) +
    geom_col(fill = wes_palette("Moonrise1", 1)) +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(title = "Candidate Political Party Count", 
         x = "", y = "Count") +
    theme_minimal()
```


```{r}
potus_election %>% group_by(party_name) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(party_name %in% c("Democratic Party", "Republican Party")) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(vote_count)) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = party_name, y = count, fill = count)) +
    geom_col(fill = wes_palette("Moonrise2", 1)) +
    labs(title = "Count of Votes Recieved by Party", subtitle = "Aggregated by all races",
         x = "", y = "Count") +
    theme_minimal()
    
```


```{r}
# remove numbers from office name
potus_election$race <- str_replace_all(potus_election$office, "[0-9]", "")
```

- The less "prestigeous" office, the fewer amount of voters participate in. This could be due to the voting ballot listing the candidates in office order from left to right, potentailly fatiguing voters to vote for less known candidates in races they are unclear about.

```{r}
# vote participation by office type?
potus_election %>% group_by(race) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(vote_count)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  mutate(rank = 1:nrow(.)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(rank < 6) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = fct_reorder(race, count), y = count)) +
    geom_col(fill = wes_palette("Moonrise3", 1)) +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(title = "Count of Votes Recieved by Office", subtitle = "Aggregated by all candidates",
         x = "", y = "Count") +
    theme_minimal()
```
