Local Connecticut Election &amp; Voter Data Analytics Projects. The name of the code repository is taken from [_The Republic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)) and of course [Scandal](http://abc.go.com/shows/scandal).

_I'm interested in learning about data analytics for election campaigns and will be storing papers, links, and projects as I learn about new statistics, modeling and Bayesian approaches._ 

## Project Ideas üí°

- ‚úÖ [EDA of 2016 National and Regional Election results from the SOTS Election center app ](https://jasdumas.github.io/the-republic/exploratory_data_analysis_sots_election_app.html)

- ‚è≥ [Web scraping the date of data availability from the SOTS Election center app](data-availability.Rmd)
     
- ‚è≥ Extracting voter registration data from PDF's from the [SOTS Statistics & Data Portal](http://portal.ct.gov/SOTS/Election-Services/Statistics-and-Data/Statistics-and-Data)

- Third party analysis
     1. _Is there a growing interest in third party candidates?_

- Correlation analysis of historical Party success and flips in each district
     1. _What makes a district (or county in CT) flip in majority?_

- Age cohort progression model: 
     1. _Do voters of a certain age cohort vote consistently each election cycle as they progress in age?_

- Social media sentiment for 2018 Governor candidates
     1. _Can the 2018 Governor race be predicted given social media influence?_
     
- 2017 Municipal Election
     1. Ballot info: http://portal.ct.gov/SOTS/Election-Services/Town-Ballots/2017-Town-Ballots
