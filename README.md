# The Republic
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlATpsNOlkDq6LC/giphy.gif" alt="olivia-pope" align="right">

Local Connecticut Election &amp; Voter Data Analytics Projects. The name of the code repository is taken from [_The Republic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)) and of course [Scandal](http://abc.go.com/shows/scandal).

I'm interested in learning about data analytics for election campaigns and will be storing papers, links, and projects as I learn about new statistics, modeling and Bayesian approaches. 

## Project Ideas :bulb:

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis of 2016 National and Regional Election results](https://jasdumas.github.io/the-republic/web_scraping_sots_election_app.html) from the [election center app](http://ctemspublic.pcctg.net/#/home)
     1. Data Source: [2016 Presidential Election Results data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakekara/ct-election-2016-certified-data/master/output/merged_state_votes_pretty.csv) - courtesy of jkara@trendct.org

2. Third party analysis
     1. _Is there a growing interest in third party candidates?_

3. Correlation analysis of historical Party success and flips in each district
     1. _What makes a district (or county in CT) flip in majority?_

4. Age cohort progression model: 
     1. _Do voters of a certain age cohort vote consistently each election cycle as they progress in age?_

5. Social media sentiment for 2018 Governor candidates
     1. _Can the 2018 Governor race be predicted given social media influence?_
     
6. 2017 Municipal Election
     1. Ballot info: http://portal.ct.gov/SOTS/Election-Services/Town-Ballots/2017-Town-Ballots

7. ... (got any cool ideas for me? :arrow_right: [email me](mailto:jasmine.dumas@gmail.com))
