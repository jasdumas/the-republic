Local Connecticut Election &amp; Voter Data Analytics Projects. The name of the code repository is taken from [_The Republic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)) and of course [Scandal](http://abc.go.com/shows/scandal).

I'm interested in learning about data analytics for election campaigns and will be storing papers, links, and projects as I learn about new statistics, modeling and Bayesian approaches. 

## Project Ideas :bulb:

1. [Web scraping](web_scraping_sots_election_app.html) or getting the raw data from the [election center app](http://ctemspublic.pcctg.net/#/home)
     1. [2016 Presidential Election Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakekara/ct-election-2016-certified-data/master/output/merged_state_votes_pretty.csv) - courtesy of jkara@trendct.org

2. Third party analysis

3. Correlation analysis of historical Party success and flips in each district

4. Age cohort progression model

5. Social media sentiment for 2018 Governor candidates

6. ... (got any cool ideas for me? :arrow_right: [email me](mailto:jasmine.dumas@gmail.com))
