Local Connecticut Election &amp; Voter Data Analytics Projects. The name of the code repository is taken from [_The Republic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)) and of course [Scandal](http://abc.go.com/shows/scandal).

I'm interested in learning about data analytics for election campaigns and will be storing papers, links, and projects as I learn about new statistics, modeling and Bayesian approaches. 

## Project Ideas :bulb:

1. [Web scraping](web_scraping_sots_election_app.html) or getting the raw data from the election center app - http://ctemspublic.pcctg.net/#/home
     1. [2016 Presidential Election Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakekara/ct-election-2016-certified-data/master/output/merged_state_votes_pretty.csv) - courtesy of jkara@trendct.org

2. Third party analysis

3. Correlation analysis of historical Party success and flips in each district

4. Age cohort progression model

5. ... (got any cool ideas for me? :arrow_right: [email me](mailto:jasmine.dumas@gmail.com))
